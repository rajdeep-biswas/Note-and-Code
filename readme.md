/Python: Using `enumerate()` is a slightly more elegant way to iterate through the indices of an iteratble.
/Engineering: Anagram problem can use a simple check upfront if the string lengths are matching. Good engineering practices like these can save you computation.
/Python: Using `get()` with dictionaries is very handy. Especially, in cases where you're trying iterate through a list to get frequency of its elements, etc.
