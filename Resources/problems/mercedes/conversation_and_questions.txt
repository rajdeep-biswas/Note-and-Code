Problem: input: numerical data
Objective: train a regression model

Step 1 EDA

What the nature of the numerical columns?
How many of them are categorical?
“ continuous?
Range of each?

Gather as much SME on each column
Derive meaningful features out of them
	Might require feature engineering

Stats of data
	Central tendencies
	Distributions
	Outliers

Visualizations
	

Result: we know what our data looks like.

| Assumption: no non-numeric columns exist, if they do, we won’t use them

Step 2 Model Building

Independent / dependent variables going by usecase

(X, y)

Understand the nature of growth of y
	Simple linear function
	Polynomial function
	More nuanced seasonality and trend

Choose model according to nature of data


Data collection (balanced dataset is available) -> EDA taken care of
Base model is available
Finetuning / training model done

W&B -> pickle file

Create a python application (Django)
This hosts the inferencing model endpoint
Dockerized and includes the pickle model file

Docker file needs to be hosted at hyperscaler

classifiers M1 and M2
choose best model


def mean(arr):
	return sum(arr) / len(arr)

def median(arr):
	arr.sort()
	if not len(arr) % 2:
		return (arr[len(arr) // 2] + arr[len(arr) // 2 + 1]) / 2
	else:
		return arr[len(arr) // 2]
